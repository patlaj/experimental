Provide feedback on <a href="afeedback-03-05-en.html">ESDC’s Accessibility Plan</a>, your experience of our institution’s accessibility, or any other matter related to accessibility. Find out how we'll use your feedback.</p>

<h2 id="what">What we will do with your feedback</h2>
<p>Your feedback will help us advance our accessibility efforts.  We will address feedback right away where we can.  Some feedback may have to be addressed in the development of future accessibility plans.  This process will be transparent.  The feedback we receive and how we take it into consideration will be included in our progress reports and published in the years between accessibility plans.</p>
<h3>Acknowledging your feedback</h3>
<p>You will receive an automatic confirmation when you submit the Accessibility feedback form online.  Acknowledging receipt for feedback made by other means will take longer.  We will provide confirmation by the same means of communication used to communicate with us.  Our message will confirm that we have received feedback, include our service standard for replying to comments and explain that more complex issues will take more time to solve.</p>
<h3>Responding and resolving issues</h3>
<p>We will respond by email to comments received through the online form or by email within 5 business days.</p>
  <p>Finding answers or solutions to more complex issues might take more time. If that is the case for your comment(s), we will let you know within 5 business days upon receiving your feedback.</p>
<h3>Compiling and analyzing feedback</h3>
<p>We will analyze feedback for trends and patterns. We will present our analysis and explain the follow-up actions we have taken in our annual progress reports on accessibility and in our future accessibility plans.</p>
<h2 id="anonymous">Anonymous feedback</h2>
<p>Your feedback will always remain anonymous in our public reports.  We will not identify you with your feedback beyond our Accessibility Office.  The only time your feedback will be connected to you is when you request a personal response.</p>
<p>To provide anonymous feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>do not state your name or provide any identifying information</li>
<li>state that you would like your feedback to remain anonymous if your email address includes your name</li> 
<li>do not include your return address on the envelope for physical mail</li>
</ul>
