<h2 id="anonymous">Anonymous feedback</h2>
<p>You can provide feedback and remain fully anonymous if you use the online questionnaire, the phone or VRS. To ensure anonymity, do not state your name or provide any identifying information.</p>
<p>If you are using an email address that includes your name and want to remain anonymous, <strong>state that you would like your feedback to remain anonymous</strong>. That way, we will not identify you with your feedback with anyone beyond PCH’s Accessibility Office</p>
<p>For physical mail, if you would like to remain fully anonymous, please <strong>do not include your return address</strong> on the envelope. If you would like to receive an acknowledgement with a response regarding your feedback, please let us know within your feedback that you would like to remain anonymous but receive a response back.  We will not identify you with your feedback for anyone beyond the Accessibility Office.</p>
<p>Please note that all feedback will be anonymized when we report publicly on all feedback that we have received.</p>
<h2 id="what">What we will do with your feedback</h2>
<p>We will use your feedback to advance our accessibility efforts. Some feedback may be addressed right away, and some may be addressed in the development of our future accessibility plans. The feedback we receive and how we take it into consideration will be included in our progress reports, published in the years between accessibility plans.</p>
<h3>Acknowledging your feedback</h3>
<p>If you make comments through the online questionnaire, you will receive an automatic confirmation that we received them.
  Acknowledging receipt for comments made by other means will take longer. We will reply by the same means of communication used to communicate with us.
  Our acknowledgement message will confirm that we have received comments, include our service standard for replying to comments and explain that more complex issues will take more time to solve.</p>
<h3>Responding and resolving issues</h3>
<p>We will respond by email to comments received through the online questionnaire or by email within 5 business days.
  Note that finding answers or solutions to more complex issues might take more time. If that is the case for your comment(s), we will let you know within 5 business days upon receiving your feedback.</p>
<h3>Compiling and analyzing feedback</h3>
<p>We will compile all comments that we receive to analyze them for trends and patterns. We will present our analysis and explain the follow-up actions we have taken in our annual progress reports on accessibility and in our future accessibility plans.</p>
