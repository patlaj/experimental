<h2 id="anonymous">Anonymous feedback</h2>
<p>You can provide feedback and remain fully anonymous if you use the online form, the phone or VRS. Do not state your name or provide any identifying information to ensure anonymity.</p>
<p><strong>State that you would like your feedback to remain anonymous</strong> if your email address includes your name and want to remain anonymous. We will not identify you with your feedback beyond our Accessibility Office</p>
<p><strong>Do not include your return address</strong> on the envelope for physical mail if you want to remain fully anonymous. If you would like to receive an acknowledgement with a response regarding your feedback, please let us know within your feedback that you would like to remain anonymous but receive a response back.  We will not identify you with your feedback for anyone beyond the Accessibility Office.</p>
<p>Please note that all feedback will be anonymized when we report publicly on all feedback that we have received.</p>
<h2 id="what">What we will do with your feedback</h2>
<p>Your feedback will help us advance our accessibility efforts.  We will address feedback right away where we can.  Some feedback may have to be addressed in the development of future accessibility plans.  This process will be transparent.  The feedback we receive and how we take it into consideration will be included in our progress reports and published in the years between accessibility plans.</p>
<h3>Acknowledging your feedback</h3>
<p>You will receive an automatic confirmation when you submit the Accessibility feedback form online.  Acknowledging receipt for feedback made by other means will take longer.  We will provide confirmation by the same means of communication used to communicate with us.  Our message will confirm that we have received feedback, include our service standard for replying to comments and explain that more complex issues will take more time to solve.</p>
<h3>Responding and resolving issues</h3>
<p>We will respond by email to comments received through the online questionnaire or by email within 5 business days.
  Note that finding answers or solutions to more complex issues might take more time. If that is the case for your comment(s), we will let you know within 5 business days upon receiving your feedback.</p>
<h3>Compiling and analyzing feedback</h3>
<p>We will analyze feedback for trends and patterns. We will present our analysis and explain the follow-up actions we have taken in our annual progress reports on accessibility and in our future accessibility plans.</p>
